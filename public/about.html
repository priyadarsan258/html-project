<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am Priyadarsan Das, a multi-talented individual who wears many hats as a
  developer, singer, rapper, and cooking enthusiast. Currently working at TCS, I
  am skilled in web development with a strong command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  and React, allowing me to create dynamic and engaging digital experiences.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond coding, my passion extends to music, where I express myself through
  singing and rapping, blending creativity with rhythm. I also love
  experimenting in the kitchen, crafting unique dishes that reflect my love for
  flavors and innovation.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding or making music, you’ll find me immersed in the world of
  fiction, exploring new stories and ideas that fuel my imagination. With a
  curious mind and a drive for continuous learning, I aim to push my boundaries
  and excel in both my personal and professional life. I believe in the power of
  creativity, whether it's developing a complex web application or composing a
  new song, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that allow me to
  grow and inspire others.
